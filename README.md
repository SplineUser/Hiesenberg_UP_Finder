# Heisenbergs Uncertainty Principle value finder and predictor 

This script utilizes the Heisenberg's uncertainty to calculate the uncertainty in momentum or the position when one of the input is given; then it plots it onto a graph with the accurate value aswell as predicted values

## How it works

1. When you run the Jupyter notebook script; you will be asked to input the value of Δx or Δp
2. The program will find the value of Δx or Δp
3. The program will plot the value into the graph with the predicted values also mentioned

## Forumales

Δx.Δp = ħ/2

## Requirement 
1. Appropriate environment to the jupyter notebook script

## How to run
1. Clone repository
2. Run the Jupyter notebook script
